# MAB

## Description
Multi-armed Bandit library. It provides implementation of main algorithms like:

- EpsionGreedy
- BetaTS
- Softmax
- UCB1
- AnnealingSoftmax
- AnnealingEpsionGreedy
- AB testing
- Random Select

Also, the package enables trial simulations:

- Motecarlo Simulation

with different types of rewards

- Bernoulli Arms (binary rewards)
- Uniform Arms   (uniformly distributed rewards)

## How to Install

Two ways to install:

- Clone this repository
- `pip install mab-hakuinadvisors`

## How to use

The best usage example can be found in the file `simulation.ipynb`

The package can be used as
- A part of another library or software
- API (in progress)
- Theoretical learning by using simulations like in `simulation.ipynb` or with different types of rewards, algorythms and simulation parameters
